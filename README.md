# Planda - Product Specification Repository

This repository contains the comprehensive product specification, research documentation, and planning materials for **Planda**, a multi-identity location-based social network.

## What is Planda?

Planda is the next generation of social networking—a platform that enables users to maintain multiple distinct identities for different aspects of their lives (business, family, sports, hobbies, relationships, etc.). It combines:

- **Multi-identity profiles** - Separate contexts for every life aspect
- **Topic-centric communities** - Deep, specialized communities for every interest
- **Location-aware networking** - Connect online discussions with real-world local interactions
- **Self-governing communities** - DAO-inspired liquid democracy for transparent governance
- **Generalized offers system** - Jobs, events, collaborations, and opportunities

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for:

1. **Product Vision & Strategy** - Core value propositions and target users
2. **Feature Specifications** - Detailed requirements for all platform capabilities
3. **Platform Research** - Analysis of existing platforms (Reddit, Meetup, Skool, LinkedIn, DAOs)
4. **Architecture Planning** - Technical approach and system design considerations
5. **Governance Models** - Democratic decision-making and trust network mechanisms
