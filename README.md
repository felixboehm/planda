## What is Planda?

Planda is the next generation of social networking—a platform that enables users to maintain multiple distinct identities for different aspects of their lives (business, family, sports, hobbies, relationships, etc.). It combines:

- **Multi-identity profiles** - Separate contexts for every life aspect

- **Self-governing communities** - DAO-inspired liquid democracy for transparent governance
- **Generalized offers system** - Jobs, events, collaborations, and opportunities

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for:

1. **Product Vision & Strategy** - Core value propositions and target users
2. **Feature Specifications** - Detailed requirements for all platform capabilities
3. **Platform Research** - Analysis of existing platforms (Reddit, Meetup, Skool, LinkedIn, DAOs)
4. **Architecture Planning** - Technical approach and system design considerations
5. **Governance Models** - Democratic decision-making and trust network mechanisms
