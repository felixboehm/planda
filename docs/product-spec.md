# Planda - Multi-Identity Location-Based Social Network
## Product Specification v2.0

## Executive Summary

Planda is the next generation of social networking—a multi-identity, topic-focused platform that empowers users to create separate profiles for every aspect of their lives (business, family, sports, hobbies, relationships, etc.).

## Conclusion

Planda represents a paradigm shift in social networking—moving from the one-size-fits-all profile model to a multi-faceted identity system that mirrors how people actually live their lives. By combining topic-centric communities (Reddit), location-based discovery (Meetup), learning communities (Skool), and democratic governance (DAOs), Planda creates something genuinely new: a platform where users can be their full, authentic, multi-dimensional selves while maintaining privacy and context separation.

The key innovations are:
1. **Multiple Identities**: Professional, family, hobbies, sports, relationships - all separate yet manageable
2. **Deep Communities**: Topic-focused spaces with real governance, not just moderation
3. **Liquid Democracy**: True community self-management with transparent, delegated decision-making
4. **Universal Offers**: Jobs, events, collaborations - anything can be an opportunity
5. **Integrated Learning**: Every community can teach and learn

Success depends on nailing the core user experience (identity management must feel natural, not complex), achieving critical mass in key cities and topics, and proving that community governance works at scale. The vision is ambitious but addresses real pain points: context collapse on social media, lack of control over online communities, disconnection between online discussion and offline action, and the need to juggle multiple apps for different life contexts.

Planda isn't just another social network—it's the infrastructure for how people will connect, learn, organize, and govern themselves in the digital age.
